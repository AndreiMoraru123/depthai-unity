# OAK For Unity - Prebuild demo scenes (binaries)

Do you have OAK device and want to try some of the demos even without installing Unity? We bring to you some of our demos in binary format ready to execute.

You don't have OAK device yet? Let's try it anyway with pre-recorded data so you can see what is OAK capable of.

In order to maintain the repository as light as possible, we store demo binaries as shared drive file. Please download proper version for your system.

## Known issues

- Replay data is not perfect because depth R16 is saved as 8bit images (pending to improve)
- As usual when download from internet, antivirus software may think prebuild demos are potential risk. If demo is crashing or not accessing camera, review requirements and check antivirus is not blocking.
- On Windows, smart screen warning should appear, just allow execution
